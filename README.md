##On why the dataset is interesting?


I have extracted this dataset from Kaggle API, I feel that churn modelling and prediction is one of the most important 
aspects for any company or institution. Basically churn prediction tells us the probability of new customers exiting the company
or not. It helps us to identify the  potential customers that will be more likely to exit/end the services of the company.
Churn modelling is also important because retaining the customers in the company's revenue process is most important. It is easy to
get the customers for once but then holding on to them is the difficult par. This problem is one of the more common problems applied 
in the Digital marketing arena. It tookme some  time to understand the problem and then apply the methods. By selecting this problem,
I amm trying to imply my willingness to be involved in Digital Marketing related aspects at Technomy. I am very exited and willing to 
apply my expertise to help Technonomy.

I could have chosen a problem from the Geospatial domain related to classification, but I wanted to try my skills at a different area.
Although I also did have ideas for this project, which would merge the  location intelligence aspects as well. But lets keep that for some other time.


##On the model:- 

Logistic Regression is one of the basic models of binary classification. It is important in this particular case as it allows us to know
whether a customer will churn or not. The accuracy score of the model is also decent which is 80% accrate. Of course there exists other much accurate
approaches to go about the problem, but due to the nature of the assignment, I have chosen the basic approach to demonstrate my familiarity with the concepts.
There are other multiclass multilabel classification appproaches ranging from SVM, RF, DT etc all the way to neural networks.
In my particular field of image classifcation SVM and RF are the more commonly used methods to quickly classify satellite images. 


the interpretability of this particular model is very high as we can just infer whether a customer will churn or not. as the complexity of model
increses the interpretaability of the model decreses. I have come across many such cases in my own domain of expertise. This model is easy to understand even from a 
Layman's perspective. Sometimes in our production processes we need to go with the well established ( as opposed to highly innovative and new approaches) in 
order to interpret it wasily and aptly.
